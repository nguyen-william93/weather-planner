Learning server side API

This project is about learning the sever side API.
I used the openweatherAPI. The webiste required the user to search for a city or state or location. If the location is valid, it will display weather information for the current weather and the weather forecast for the next 5 days. Each search is also get save to the local storage then get display as a button on the side. The user has the option to click on button instead of searching for a city again.
The infomation about the weather include temperature, wind speed, UVI, humidity, and a weather icon.
